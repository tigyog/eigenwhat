# What is a vector?

* Start chapter :b

In school, you learned how to plot points on "math paper".
Here are two example points:

TODO

We call the horizontal line $x$ and the vertical line $y$.
We draw a number line on each of them.
Then we can describe any point on the paper using the point's position on each line.
The red point has $x = 2$ and $y = 3$.
What is the $x$ value of the blue point?
:buttons{#dlg5n}

* $3$ :b{#ye00u .correct}
* $4$ :b{#b8q8b .incorrect}

  No, that's actually the blue point's $y$ value.
  To get its $x$ value, read across the horizontal.

  * Okay :b
