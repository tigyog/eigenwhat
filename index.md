## Linear algebra for machine learning

You want to build AIs,
but got stuck with matrix multiplication?
Many tasks in machine learning require basic linear algebra.
This course quickly gets you up to speed with the minimum you need to be productive.
The only prerequisite is that youâ€™re comfortable coding.
I emphasize Python code like `[1,2]` instead of math squiggles like $\begin{bmatrix}1 \\ 2\end{bmatrix}$.
